Welcome to the Arkiv Android app.
The purpose with Arkiv is to make it easy to save electronic copies of important
papers, such as invoices, receipt etc.

When starting the app, the user can point the camera to the item who needs to be saved 
and the pressing on of the buttons on thr screen to specify the type of the item.
Then a picture is taken and stored on the SD card in the folder "Arkiv/<type>"
with the filename <type><date and time>.jpg

If an email address is specified a mail is created and by selecting a mail application
from the chooser pop-up the mail can be sent.
Then the item is stored in that mail account.

The Arkiv app is build for Android 2.2 and tested on Sony Ericsson X10 Mini running Android 2.3.7 (CM7).
