Things left to do:

1. Use OCR (TesserAct) to detect sub-categories [Optional]

2. Widget

3. Search in the archive

Known issues:

1. Email is not sent directly because Google don't allow it for security reasons.
   To support this "sendmail" needs to be implemented in the App. Not worth it!
   
2. Camera preview not working after screen off.

3. Gallery: Zoom is not working properly. Impossible to zoom out on large images.

4. Gallery: Folder names not scaled correctly for folders where first image have low resolution. (minor)  

5.
