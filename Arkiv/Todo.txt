Things left to do:

1. Add preferences such as email address and if mails shall be sent.
2. Add help
3. Add About


Known issues:

1. Camera preview orientation not working correct.
   Without adjustment the camera preview will be wrong (90 degrees) in Portrait mode.
   With adjustment the camera preview will be wrong in Landscape mode.

2. Email is not sent directly because Google don't allow it for security reasons.
   To support this "sendmail" needs to be implemented in the App. Not worth it!
