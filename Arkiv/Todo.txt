Things left to do:

1. Verify on different mobiles and different Android versions.
2. Implement own image gallery to only show archived items.

Known issues:

1. Camera preview orientation not working correct.
   Without adjustment the camera preview will be wrong (90 degrees) in Portrait mode.
   With adjustment the camera preview will be wrong in Landscape mode.

2. Email is not sent directly because Google don't allow it for security reasons.
   To support this "sendmail" needs to be implemented in the App. Not worth it!
   
3. The Arkiv button opens the Gallery app which shows all image folders, not only thos related to this app.

4. When returning from the Gallery the camera preview is not working.
