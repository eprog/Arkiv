Things left to do:

1. Implement own image gallery to only show archived items.

2. Use OCR (TesserAct) to detect sub-categories [Optional]

3. Edit/Remove sub-categories

4. Widget

5. Search in the archive

Known issues:

1. Email is not sent directly because Google don't allow it for security reasons.
   To support this "sendmail" needs to be implemented in the App. Not worth it!
   
2. The Arkiv button opens the Gallery app which shows all image folders, not only those related to this app. (Disabled in 1.0)

3. Camera preview not working after screen off.

4.
